Grasso - a FAT filesystem parser written in Python
==================================================

This is a toy FAT filesystem parser which depends only on the standard
library.

It was mostly written to scratch an itch, so don't expect it to work in
any serious manner.

The code is released under a MIT-style license, feel free to improve it.

Usage
-----

    import grasso
    image = open('fs.img', 'rb')
    fs = grasso.FATFileSystem(image)
    print [f.name for f in fs.root.files]
    print fs['/foo/bar'].read()
